\description{
The lookup table can be used for a county level analysis within a core-based statistical
area (CBSA). This table combines the state crosswalk data files available in the LEHD Origin-Destination
Employment Statistics (LODES) from the US Census. Use this data set to quickly find the counties within
a metropolitan area.

\details{
Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas are collectively referred to as Core-Based Statistical Areas.
\itemize{
  \item{Metropolitan statistical areas have at least one urbanized area of 50,000 or more population, plus
adjacent territory that has a high degree of social and economic integration with the core as measured by
commuting ties.}
  \item{Micropolitan statistical areas are a new set of statistical areas that have at least one urban
  cluster of at least 10,000 but less than 50,000 population, plus adjacent territory that has a high degree
  of social and economic integration with the core as measured by commuting ties.}
