#' QCEW Industry Codes and Titles (For NAICS Coded Data)
#'
#' The lookup table shows the industry code and title relationships applicable to NAICS
#' coded QCEW data. The QCEW program uses the North American Industry Classification
#' System (NAICS) as to assign establishments to industries and to report industry
#' data at highly detailed as well as at aggregated levels. Detailed industry NAICS
#' coded data are available for the period from 1990 forward. For reference periods
#' from 1990 to 2006 they are coded to the 2002 version of NAICS. For periods from
#' 2007 to 2011 they are coded to the 2007 version of NAICS. For periods from 2012
#' to 2016 they are coded to the 2012 version of NAICS, and for 2017 forward to the
#' 2017 version.
